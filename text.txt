in Optics a ray is an idealized model of light obtained by choosing a line that is perpendicular to the wavefront of the actual light and that points in the direction of energy flow rays are used to model the propagation of light through an optical system by dividing the real life filled up into the space race that can be computationally propagated through the system by the techniques of ray tracing is allows every Complex optical system to be analysed mathematically or simulated by computer Ray tracing uses approximate solutions to maxwell's equations that are valid as long as the light waves propagate through and around objects whose dimensions are much greater than the lights wavelength wave theory does not describe phenomena such as interference and diffraction which requires wave theory
